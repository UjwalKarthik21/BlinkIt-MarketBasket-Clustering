🛒 BlinkIT-MarketBasket-Clustering
A comprehensive Sales & Product Performance analysis project using RapidMiner for data mining and Power BI for visualization. This project explores customer buying patterns, clustering product types, and uncovering item associations from the BlinkIT grocery dataset.

📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing transactional and product-level data from BlinkIT, an online grocery delivery platform. It involves:

Market Basket Analysis using FP-Growth (Association Rules)

Customer/Product Segmentation using Clustering

Sales Insight Dashboard using Power BI

🧠 Key Objectives
Identify frequent itemsets and association rules from purchase data

Segment items or stores based on attributes using clustering (like K-Means/X-Means)

Visualize metrics like sales, product categories, fat content distribution, and outlet types

Generate actionable insights for business decisions

🛠️ Tools Used
RapidMiner

Clustering (X-Means or K-Means)

Market Basket Analysis (FP-Growth)

Preprocessing and data cleaning

Power BI

Interactive visual dashboards

Charts: Donut charts, Line charts, Bar charts

KPIs for Sales and Performance

📊 Project Components
Data Cleaning & Transformation

Null removal, label encoding, normalization

Feature selection for clustering and rules

Clustering (RapidMiner)

Used to segment items/outlets based on visibility, item type, and other features

Clusters like Cluster_0, Cluster_1 analyzed for traits

Market Basket Analysis

Applied FP-Growth to extract association rules

Analyzed combinations like Item_Type → Fat_Content

Power BI Dashboard

Visual insights on:

Product sales distribution

Fat content breakdown

Outlet size & location overview

Establishment trends over time

📈 Results
